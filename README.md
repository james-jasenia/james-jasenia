## Latest Personal Project:

### Mood
An iOS app that allows users to share short voice clips presented in a new feed. The focus of the app was to use a TDD approach and modularise the codebase into smaller projects.

An iOS app that is designed to support teachers to collect anecdotal data about their students during learning chats. Teachers are able to choose from a variety of templates to record their observations. The app organises the data into student snapshots. This enables teacher to keep track of their students curriculum understanding systematically.
