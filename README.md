![find](/ConferenceKit.jpg)

This app is designed to support teachers to collect anecdotal data about their students during learning chats. Teachers are able to choose from a variety of templates to record their observations. The app organises the data into student snapshots. This enables teacher to keep track of their students curriculum understanding systematically.
